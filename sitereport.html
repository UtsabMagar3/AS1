        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>This website provides information on the entire web development learning process. During my web development adventure, I learnt a variety of coding methodologies, design and debugging processes and more.</p>
        <br>

        <h1>Learning HTML and CSS</h1>
        <p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, which is used to create the basic structure of a website and provides an overview of it. Similarly, CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, which are utilized to style the basic HTML structure and make our website more appealing.</p>
        
        <p>Throughout my learning experience, I learned a lot about HTML, CSS, various types of tags, elements, and CSS properties. In my portfolio website, I used HTML5 and CSS3.  </p>
        <br>

        <h1>Learning Git and Github</h1>
        <p>Git is a distributed version control system (VCS) that allows developers to track changes to their codebase, whereas GitHub is a cloud-based platform that hosts Git repositories and offers extra capabilities such as collaboration, code review, and project management. Although they sound similar, their functions and applications are quite distinct.</p>
        <p>I learned different git commands for uploading different files to Github. Git clone, git push, git pull, and git commit are the most basic commands I learned and utilized over my learning journey. Aside from those commands, I learnt about repositories, branches, ways to create repositories, branches, and files on github, and more.</p>

        <br>

        <h1>Design layout</h1>
        <p>I wanted my portfolio to look more professional, therefore I chose minimal and straightforward colors. Different transition and hover effects have been employed to improve the website's appearance.My portfolio website consists of a header and section parts.The anchor tag was used to link various pages. The header section includes a navigation bar with a logo and links to different pages. 
        <br>

        <h1>Navigation bar</h1>
        <p>A navigation bar, often known as navbar, is a user interface element seen in graphical user interfaces (GUIs) including websites and applications. It is often located along the top or side of a webpage or screen and functions as a menu or guide to assist users in navigating the site or app's many parts or pages.</p>
        <p>My portfolio features a navbar at the top of the page. The navbar contains a variety of contents, including a logo and a page link. In terms of navigation bar design, I used div tags to create two divisions, with the logo on the left and different page links on the right. I display such divisions using the flex attribute. Hover effect has also been added to the page links.  </p>
        <br>
        
        <h1>Home page</h1>
        <div class="validation">
            <img src="index_valid.PNG" alt="Validation for index.html">
         </div>
        <p>The homepage of a website is the main or initial page that people usually see when they visit the site's root domain. My home page features a variety of content, including an image, an introduction, and links to social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. Different types of effects have been employed on my site to make my portfolio more visually appealing. The homepage is as simple as possible so that visitor may grasp it.</p>
        <p>In terms of the design approach, I employed several HTML tags and CSS attributes. I separated my homepage into different division and displayed them using the flex feature. Other CSS attributes like padding, margin, and shadow were also employed. I've added an opacity reduction effect to the photo while hovering it.  </p>
        <br>

        <h1>My project</h1>
        <div class="validation">
            <img src="project_valid.PNG" alt="Validation for project.html">
        </div>
        <p>This page offers a list of the projects I've completed along my development and design journey. Because I am a newbie, I have not yet made any projects, so my project page contains no content. But I've made multiple placeholders for various projects. I made multiple divisions and used a grid property to align them. Box shadows, border-radius, and colors are some of the CSS properties utilized on this page.. </p>
        <br>

        <h1>Contact</h1>
         <div class="validation">
            <img src="contact_valid.PNG" alt="Validation for contact.html">
        </div>
        <p>The Contact page allows visitors to contact me using their Gmail accounts. This page contains my various contact details, including email, phone number, address, and social media links. Links on the page connect users to my social media profiles. This page contains several HTML tags and CSS properties. Visitors can enter their name and email address and give me a note, which is saved in my email.</p>
        <br>
 
        <h1>Video demonstration</h1>
        <p>The video presentation helps the visitor understand the functioning of the website, how different sections work, and provides a complete explanation of the design and development process. </p>
        <br>
        
        <h1>Site report</h1>
        <div class="validation">
            <img src="sitereport_valid.PNG" alt="Validation for sitereport.html">
        </div>
        <br>

        <h1>Style.css</h1>
        <div class="validation">
            <img src="style_valid.PNG" alt="Validation for style.css">
        </div>
        <br>

        <h1>Responsive design</h1>
        <p>Responsive design is an essential component of modern web development that ensures websites adjust easily to various screen sizes, resolutions, and device capabilities. Responsive design helps to improve the website's performance and user experience. Adapting adaptable design allows websites to function across multiple devices. The viewport meta tag was used to create responsive design, and media queries were also employed.</p>
        <br>

        <h1>Challenges </h1>
        <p>I encountered numerous issues during the website's construction phase. Some of the difficulties included browser compatibility, responsive design issues, and content management issues.Even though it was difficult at first, I was able to overcome these challenges by conducting study on various internet platforms. I gathered several references online. All of these issues enabled me to learn and experience fresh vital lessons. </p>
        <p>But there was one issue that I couldn't overcome. When I tried to include a hamburger icon in the nav bar during mobile responsive design, it resulted in a more complex position problem. So, unfortunately, I was unable to conquer this obstacle, but I am confident that in the future, I will solve it nonetheless.</p>
        <br>

        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p>During my web development journey, I learned HTML, CSS, Git, and GitHub, which improved my abilities to design structured and visually appealing websites while managing code successfully. My portfolio page demonstrates my journey and ability in web creation.</p>
